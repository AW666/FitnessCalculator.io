      <h1>Body mass index (BMI) is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. </h1>

      <h1>The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy needed while resting in a temperate environment when the digestive system is inactive. It is the equivalent of figuring out how much gas an idle car consumes while parked. In such a state, energy will be used only to maintain vital organs, which include the heart, lungs,
        kidneys, nervous system, intestines, liver, lungs, sex organs, muscles, and skin. For most people, upwards of ~70% of total energy (calories) burned each day is due to upkeep. Physical activity makes up ~20% of expenditure and ~10% is used for the digestion of food, also known as thermogenesis.</h1>

      <h1>In the context of health and fitness, macronutrients(Macros) are most often defined to be the chemical compounds that humans consume in large quantities that provide bulk energy. Specifically, they refer to carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Some definitions also include water, air, calcium, sodium, chloride ions, and some other substances, along with more typical macronutrients, since they are needed in large quantities by the human body.</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="box5">
      <h1>Note that ideal body weight (IBW) is not a perfect measurement. It does not consider the percentages of body fat and muscle in a person's body. This means that it is possible for highly fit, healthy athletes to be considered overweight based on their IBW. This is why IBW should be considered with the perspective that it is an imperfect measure and not necessarily indicative of health, or a weight that a person should necessarily strive toward; it is possible to be over or under your "IBW" and be perfectly healthy.</h1>
